	<h2>My Home School</h2> 
	<p>My home school is a rather small school called, Tri-Village. It is located at New Madison, OH. 
	I attended Tri-Village kindergarten through fourth grade before money problems made me move to Indiana. In 2014, I came back to my home school in nineth grade. 
	I enjoyed many classes there one being band. </p>

	<h2>My Small Town</h2>
	<p>My home town is technically New Paris, OH, but we live closer to another small town. This small town is called New Madison, OH.
	I actually lived in town for awhile until we moved out to the country for some fresh air. I enjoy being close to town but not living in it. 
	Since a lot of people tend to be nosey and the animals by the woods aren't; I guess you can see why I like the country so much. </p>
