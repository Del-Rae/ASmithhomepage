			<h2>Welcome</h2>
		<p>Hello and welcome to my site. This site includes my educational goals and long-term employment goals.
		I attend Miami Valley CTC for Game Programming and Web Applications. So far, I am doing well in class.</p></article> 
		<article> 
			<h2>My Educational Goals</h2>
		<p>My educational goals are to expand on my knowledge of web design by taking simular courses at Sinclair in 2018. Then transferring to a four year college hopefully by 2021.
			I hope to successfully learn different forms of HTML during the summer and college breaks. I also hope to successfully apply what I have learned so far, and what I will learn in the future, in a future career.</p>

			<h2>My Employment Goals</h2>
			<p>My employment goals are to work at home as a web designer by 2020. Or to work at a company for web design after college. 
				I really enjoy web design and hope to pursue it as a career. I also hope to, one day, teach web design by 2040.</p>
